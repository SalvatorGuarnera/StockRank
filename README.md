# StockRank

StockRank is an iOS app geared toward ranking stocks based on various formulas and fundamentals.  

StockRank works in concurrence with StockRankDataPull to sort all stocks on the S&P 500 by the Graham Number.

The Graham Number is a stock metric that is intended to provide a ceiling for the amount of money an investor should pay for a stock.

Earnings per share and the book value per share are taken into account to calculate the Graham Number.

This app sorts all stocks on the S&P 500 by the greatest POSITIVE discrepancy between current stock price and Graham Number.  By ranking on this metric,
 an investor is able to see potentially undervalued stocks in the S&P 500.
